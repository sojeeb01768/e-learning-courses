<p>What actually I used to make this project: <br>
=> React framework/library. <br>
=> React Boostrap library for css <br>
=> Used Github to save code. <br>
=> Deploy this site on firebase. <br>
=> Used firebase authentication for login register etc. <br>
</p>



<p>What Is the feature of this Project: <br>
This is actually a online course site. Here you can buy premium courses beginner to advanced. <br>
=> Firstly  sets some data of some topics for courses (we use loader to load data from server) <br>
=> I also create a separate server from the help of google firebase <br>
=> You can choose or select any course that you like. <br>
=> There will be provided some information about course . <br>
=> Every course has different price . <br>
=> you can choose your favourite course and also can buy  <br>
=> But When you want to buy premium access you have to login otherwise you cannot access this course<br>
