            <h4>Q: WHO THIS COURSE IS FOR?</h4>
            <p>
                This course is for anyone with a basic knowledge of coding who wants to increase their knowledege
                Suitable for anyone who knows very basic coding</p>

            <h4> Q: HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT TO LEARN?</h4>
            <p>
                The most important thing is that you want to learn something that interests you, because once you start learning, you’ll be with this topic for a while. Choosing something just because it’s popular or what others are doing isn’t the way to go because if you don’t have a true interest in it, you’ll lose the motivation to learn! Spend some time seriously looking into the different tech career paths before choosing one to go down.</p>

            <h4> Q: SHOULD I USE FREE OR PAID RESOURCES TO LEARN TO CODE?</h4>
            <p>
                Free tools are great for dipping your toe into the water to see if you like coding, but generally, I recommend using paid resources. While there are some great free resources out there (see below), oftentimes you get what you pay for. Paid resources are likely to be much easier to use and understand. You’re also likely to have better support if you get stuck, and more features and perks that other (free) resources just can’t offer.

                Also, I find that when I pay for something, I’m much more motivated to use it than when I get something for free. Think of it like paying for a gym membership – you’re more likely to exercise when you pay to attend, so it’s like an added sense of accountability!

            <h4> Q: WHERE CAN I LEARN TO CODE FOR FREE?</h4>
            <p>
                One of my favorite resources is freeCodeCamp. They have thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons that are all freely available, so they’re definitely worth checking out.

                You can also check out my article highlighting a bunch of places to learn to code for free.

            <h4>Q: WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS COURSE</h4>
            <p>
                The biggest advantage of an online course is that your classroom and instructor (theoretically) are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Your only excuse for missing class is not getting online! Otherwise, everything is available to you. You can get announcements, access notes, review assignments, take practice quizzes, discuss questions, chat with fellow students and study any time you want. Other than certain due dates, you make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course.</p>
